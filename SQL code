where nationality = 'france'; 
 Output:

‚óèIr√®ne Joliot-Curie
‚óèYvonne Choquet-Bruhat



2.List all historical figures that contributed to Computing
To list all the historical figures that contributed to computing, we will do a similar code from the first question which is:

select * from person
where field = 'computing';



List all historical figures that contributed to more than 1 field
3.To list the historical figures that contribute to more than 1 field we put the code:
select name, Field
from scientists
where field like '%,%';

4.Update Mary Jackson‚Äôs incorrect death year
select *from person
update person
set lived = '1921-2005'
where name = 'Mary Jackson';

5.List all historical figures who died before they were 40 

SELECT Name, Lived,
       CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(Lived, ' - ', -1) AS UNSIGNED) -
       CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(Lived, ' - ', 1) AS UNSIGNED) AS AgeAtDeath

WHERE (
    CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(Lived, ' - ', -1) AS UNSIGNED) -
    CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(Lived, ' - ', 1) AS UNSIGNED)
) < 40;

6.select name, main_area
from person
where main_area like '%,%';


7.Which countries have the most historical figures listed
To figure out which countries have the most historical figures, the code to use it :
SELECT country_of_birth, COUNT(*) AS NumOfFigures
FROM person
GROUP BY country_of_birth
ORDER BY NumOfFigures DESC;

8.Are any historical figures still alive? If so who
If we were asking if any of the historical figures from the list are still alive, then no.
Which historical figures worked for NASA 
There are two notable figures:Katherine Johnso, a mathematician who has played a important role in calculating the trajectories and launch windows for major NASA mission including Apollo 11, the space SHuttle  program, and project Mercury  and mary jackson, an aerospace engineering
Who has worked  across multiple divisions  at NASA she is know for her contribution to aerodynamic data  is important to the advancement of supersonic flight 




9.Which historical figures worked with Einstein? 
These historical figures made remarkable contributions to ste, they have made the foundation for future development of the principle across many disciplines, Mileva Maric was a very talented mathematician and physicist, and notably the fist wife of albert einstein.Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat asle was a mathematician  and a physicists  who worked with einstein directly 
And has made a very big impact  by proving the existence of a local and uniqueness of solution to einstein vacuum equations  and the last person to work with einstein  was Emmy Noether was a pioneering theoretical physicist and a mathematician whose work specially the Neothers‚Äôs Theorem  addressed a fundamental issue in Einstein's theory  of general relativity.Though she and einstein did not work together directly  he has held her work in the highest regard.




10,Which countries have the most fields of research contributions
To figure out which countries have the most fields of research contributions, we will have to type a code in order to get the list, and the code is:

select country_of_birth,count(distinct main_area) AS num_main_area
from person
group by country_of_birth
order by num_main_area DESC;
